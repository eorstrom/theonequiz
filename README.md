> Fork this repository into your Github account. All questions should be answered with code (commented with the question number, if you please). 
> Please try this as a *closed-book* quiz first. If you needed to look something up, comment where you found the answer next to your response.

## HTML and CSS

> For this section, I wrote some starter DOM elements in the `index.html` file. All answers should be coded into main.css or main.js as required by the question.

1. Write a selector that selects only the first each sibling's li elements. Make the text for that item bold, and underlined.
2. Make all li elements behave as inline elements.
3. Only the odd section elements should have a border.
4. Only the even li elements should have a lime background.
5. Only the first aside element in the 2nd section should have blue font color.
6. There are three div elements with instructions inside them about which side of the screen they should be displayed on. Follow those instructions.
7. Using vanilla JavaScript, update the HTML of the element with the id of `vanilla_output` with the following text: "This content generated with vanilla JavaScript".
8. Using jQuery, update the HTML of the element with the id of `jquery_output` with the following text: "This content generated with jQuery".

## JavaScript concepts

### Functions and operators

> In `main.js` do the following:

1. Write a function named `modulus` that takes two arguments. The function should use the modulo operator to return the remainder between the first and second arguments.  e.g. `modulus(10, 3) // Should return 1`.
1. Write a function named `doMath`. This function takes three arguments.  The first two will contain integer values. The third argument will be a function reference. Write two more functions named `add` and `subtract`. Execute the `doMath` function to add two numbers together. Then execute the `doMath` function to subtract the two numbers.

### Arrays

> In the `main.js`, I started you off with a simple array.

1. Write a function named `sortedPlanets` that returns an array of the planet names sorted alphabetically.
1. Write a function named `reversedPlanets` that returns an array of planet names that are reversed (i.e. "htraE").
1. Write a function named `longPlanets` that returns an array containing only the planet names that are 7 characters long, or longer.
